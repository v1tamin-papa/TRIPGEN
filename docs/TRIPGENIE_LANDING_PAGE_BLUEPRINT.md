```

**Layout**: Featured testimonial large, then 2-column grid below

**Featured Testimonial** (Large card with photo):
```
"I'm a consultant who travels 30+ weeks a year. TripGenie has genuinely
changed my life. What used to take me 3-4 hours now takes 5 minutes,
and the recommendations are actually better than what I'd find myself.

Last month, it found me a boutique hotel in Tokyo that wasn't on ANY
booking site—just because I mentioned I love mid-century design. I
don't know how it does it, but I'm never going back to manual planning."
```
- **Marcus Thompson**, Senior Consultant, McKinsey & Company
- Photo: Professional headshot, warm smile, business casual
- Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Testimonial 2**:
```
"We have two kids under 5. Planning family trips used to mean staying
up until midnight after they went to bed. Now I just tell TripGenie
'family beach vacation, toddler-friendly, under $4K' and it handles
everything—even finds hotels with cribs and kid menus."
```
- **Jennifer & David Park**, Parents of 2, Seattle
- Photo: Casual family-style photo
- Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Testimonial 3**:
```
"As someone who's used EVERY travel app out there, TripGenie is the
first one that actually feels intelligent. It's like texting a friend
who happens to be a travel expert with unlimited time to research."

## 8. FAQ SECTION

**Section Headline**:
```
Questions? We've Got Answers.
```

**Layout**: Accordion-style FAQ, single column, centered (max-width: 700px)

**FAQ 1**:
- **Q**: "How is this different from ChatGPT or other AI travel tools?"
- **A**: "Great question. ChatGPT can suggest ideas, but it can't check real-time availability, compare actual prices, or book anything. TripGenie is connected to live inventory—hotels, flights, restaurants, activities—so everything we recommend is actually bookable at the prices we show. Plus, we remember your preferences across trips, so we get better over time."

**FAQ 2**:
- **Q**: "What if I don't like the itinerary it creates?"
- **A**: "Just tell it what to change, in plain English. 'Swap the hotel for something cheaper.' 'Add more food experiences.' 'I hate museums, remove them all.' TripGenie adapts in seconds. Unlimited revisions, always."

**FAQ 3**:
- **Q**: "Is my data safe? Do you sell my information?"
- **A**: "Never. Your travel preferences and personal information are encrypted and never sold to third parties. We make money from your subscription and small booking commissions—not from your data. Full privacy policy available anytime."

**FAQ 4**:
- **Q**: "What if I need to change my trip after booking?"
- **A**: "TripGenie helps you manage changes, but cancellation policies depend on the airlines, hotels, and services you booked. We always show cancellation terms before you book, and we'll help you navigate changes if plans shift."

**FAQ 5**:
- **Q**: "Can I use TripGenie for business travel?"
- **A**: "Absolutely. Many of our users are frequent business travelers. For teams that need expense integrations and centralized billing, check out TripGenie for Business."

**FAQ 6**:
- **Q**: "What destinations do you support?"
- **A**: "TripGenie works worldwide. We have the strongest coverage in North America, Europe, and popular Asian destinations, but we're expanding coverage constantly. If we can't find great options somewhere, we'll tell you."

**FAQ 7**:
- **Q**: "Is there a free trial?"
- **A**: "Yes! 14 days completely free, no credit card required. Plan a trip (or three), see how much time you save, then decide if it's worth $29/month. We think you'll be convinced after your first itinerary."
